#  _Go Food Yourself_

## _Overview_
3
For this project we created a web app that allows the user to choose ingredients form a categorized list of Items that they have handy, and generate a recipe made with the chosen ingredients. There is also an admin mode that will allow you to add ingredients and recipes if you find that necessary. This app was created using Sequalize, MySQL, jQuery, Node, and Waypoint. It follws an MVC design pattern, and is deployed to Heroku.

## _Future Development and Features_
13
The main goals we have for the future development of this app are as follows
14
1. Formatting the list so that the recipes closest to having all of the selected ingredients is first and the one with the least is last.
15
1. Adding a search form on the ingredients to aid in the selection process.
16
1. Adding dietary restrictions or cuisine preferences e.g. Vegitarian, Mexican, Italian, Gluten Free
17
1. Generating a shopping list from a recipe that you like but might not have the majority of ingredients for.
18
1. Allowing for a link to a delivery service that will be filled with the missing ingredients from youyour chosen recipes.
19
1. User authentication so that you can login and save favorite recipes for later.
