## *Staying connected after graduation*
[Here is a link to the website](herokulinkhere.com)<br>
In this app we created a website allowing for coding bootcamp students to stay connected well after graduation. We have allowed for several features in its functionality including:
1. Users to create a login and password 
2. Select preferences such as:<br> 
*Seeking a job.<br>
*Coding language preference. <br>
3.User profile page with custom preferences.
4. Displays jobs available with set presences from user profile. 
5. Aggregate page of all usersâ€™ profiles
