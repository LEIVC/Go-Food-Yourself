# Go-Food-Yourself<br> 
## *Create a dish based off of what you have!*
### Motivation:
*The classic scenario of  being left with random ingredients and no discernible outcome for a meal.<br>This can have an adverse effect on one’s nutrition & meal quality.<br>
*Roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption <br>every year— approximately 1.3 billion tons — gets lost or wasted.<br>
### Concept
*Create an app that generates recipes based off selections & inputs.<br>
*Generated lists for ingredients<br>
*Users can dynamically add to the database if a listed item is not shown<br>
### Design Process<br>
*Using categorical lists for ingredients<br>
* Once the list is created from user selection the many to many database relation <br> checks recipes that fit your ingredients<br>
*Used a Post method on a separate page to add recipes<br>

### Technologies Used<br>
  *Many-to-many relationships<br>
  *WayPoint<br>
  *Animate CSS<br>
### Future Development<br>
  *Dietary restrictions<br>
  *Shopping list generated<br>
  *Delivery of missing ingredients<br>
  *User authentication to save recipes.<br>
