[Here is a link to the website](herokulinkhere.com)
In this app we created a website allowing for coding bootcamp students to stay connected well after graduation. We have allowed for several features in its functionality including:
1. Users to create a login and password 
2. Select preferences such as: 
..*Seeking a job.
..*Coding language preference. ..
3.User profile page with custom preferences.
4. Displays jobs available with set presences from user profile. 
5. Aggregate page of all usersâ€™ profiles
